# Python-project
This work is my Final project for Python course (8090 - Special topics in BANA) at University of Cincinnati.

I have attempted to predict the products in the basket of an Instacart customer when he/she next places an order. Instacart is a web-based service that enables customers to buy groceries from local shops via their website or app.
The dataset contains approximately 3 million records of orders placed by customers.

This analysis makes prediction based on last order history. Such analysis can be used to build a recommendation system.
