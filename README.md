# Python-project
This work is my Final project for Python course (8090 - Special topics in BANA) at University of Cincinnati.

Using Market Basket Analysis (MBA), I have attempted to identify the most frequent combination of the products bought by the customers of Instacart. Instacart is a web-based service that enables customers to buy groceries from local shops via their website or app.
The dataset contains approximately 3 million records of orders placed by customers.

Market Basket Analysis helps check whether the purchase of one product increases the likelihood of the purchase of other products. This knowledge is a tool for the marketers to bundle the products or strategize a product cross sell to a customer. Such analysis can be used to build a recommendation system.
